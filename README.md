### Objective

This course teaches the basics of React Native development. We want to help you create the best of breed user experiences and mobile applications.

‚Üí [index](#index)

### Who Should Attend

The training will start at a low level, and does not require in depth knowledge of the platform in question. Desirable participant profile: trainees and outside Globant candidates. A basic knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, React is desired, though.
For React you can check React + Redux Bootcamp

‚Üí [index](#index)

### Duration

Five weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and two weeks for app development.

‚Üí [index](#index)

### Technical Assistance

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance. We will create one chat for boot camp members only, and another one for boot camp members and tutors when boot camp starts.

### Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice and sprint

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

‚Üí [index](#index)


### Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted.

‚Üí [index](#index)

### Tools

1. If you are on Windows you will need Android SDK and android emulator or device. 
   On Linux you will need Android SDK and android emulator or device.
   On Mac you can add Xcode and iOS Simulator or Android SDK and android emulator or device.

   Note: For Android we recommend installing Andoid Studio, that comes with SDK

2. Install Node and NPM [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3. The IDE to use is [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). But you can use the edit of your choice Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, etc

4. Skype Account + headset (audio calls), Slack

5. Create your own[ GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this[ guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account.

‚Üí [index](#index)


### General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room.

2. The next two weeks will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. The project manager will coordinate learning days encouraging team communication in daily meetings.

4. The project manager will gather information regarding individual progress so we can look for alternative assistance where needed.

5. The project manager will lead the boot camp sprints as if it were a real project using SCRUM agile methodology.

6. Two boot camp chats will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    1. Bootcamp React Native - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

    2. Bootcamp React Native - Assistants
Here you will reach just your boot camp fellows for asking question sharing knowledge.

7. Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

8. Sprint duration will be 1 week.

9. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

10. All code and documentation must be in English.

11. Code must adhere to Globant‚Äôs UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

### Learning Days

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for the next generation mobile apps.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. üìñ Read:
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2. ‚úçÔ∏è Practice: 
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don‚Äôt have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3. üì¨ Commit: 
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

### Introduction

At high level you could see the keys as:

![technologies logos](assets/RN_logo.png "The platform")

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components.

* Using Chrome console to debug JavaScript [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console)

##### ‚úçÔ∏è Practice: #####

**Use Try to use as much ECMAScript 6 syntax as you can. Favor ```let``` and ```const``` over ```var```**

1. Create a new React Native proyect using the react native client.

2. In the root page create two lines of text - 1 - "Hello" and 2 - "World"

3. Add some styles to center the text and set a blue color

4. Add a button below the text, to your component.

5. Attach a touch event to the created button which calls a function that changes the text to 
"React Native" and "Bootcamp"

6. Add a list to the page

7. Create a service that fetches from ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/user```

8. Add a button and attach a touch event that loads the items in the list


##### Key Points: #####

3, 5, 8

##### üì≤ Mobile Test: #####

Test your code in a mobile device or in Android emulator.

Hint: A good option to test your code in a mobile device is to use Genymotion Android Emulator [http://www.genymotion.com/], which is one of the most fast and easy mobile emulators to install.

##### Commit: #####

#### Topic 7: Navigation - StackNavigator
In this Topic we will focus on learning how to use the React Native navigation library. This library is a third party as the built in navigation was deprecated because of performance issues

##### üìñ Reading: #####

1. Documentation on the differente navigators can be found here[https://reactnavigation.org/](https://reactnavigation.org/)

2. Specific to StackNavigator [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/stack](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/stack)

##### ‚úçÔ∏è Practice: #####

1. Add a StackNavigator

2. Create a new page with two <Text> compoents

3. Inside each teaxt add ```name``` and ```email``` of the user

4. Using the previous work, add a touch event on the list items.

5. Add a touch event on the list items

6. When an item is touched we should naigate to the new page passing the user as an argument

7. Show ```name``` and ```email```in the <Text> components

##### Key Points:#####

1, 6, 7

##### Commit:#####

##### ‚úçÔ∏è Practice: #####

1. Create a TabNavigator

2. Create 2 Screens for 2 of the tabs

3. On the third one add a nested StackNavigator with 2 Screens

4. In each screen add a <Text>{Number of screen}</Text> at the top. Example:

```html
<Text>Screen 1</Text> // Tab 1
<Text>Screen 2</Text> // Tab 2
<Stack>               // Tab 3
    <Text>Screen 3.1</Text> This is the default
    <Text>Screen 3.2</Text>
<Stack>
```

5. On screen 3.1 add a <Button> that when touched it navigates to Screeen 3.2

#### It‚Äôs time for the real thing. ####

You will work on a project to achieve a fully working multi platform mobile app developed in React Native.

You will apply all the knowledge obtained during the learning weeks.

You‚Äôll be given with a backlog of user stories you will estimate with your PM.

Once estimated, user stories will be divided into sprints of one week.

You will participate on daily scrum meetings.
Will you be able to consult documentation? Of course! You will be able to use any resource you know that helps you complete your user stories, be it going back to documentation sites, tutorials or just googling what you need. Luckily the web is plenty of awesome resources waiting for you to grasp them!

#### Commits ####

You will commit your code to GitHub on a daily basis.

#### Reviews ####

üëÆ Tutors will give you feedback at the end of each sprint by reviewing and commenting your committed code in GitHub. If possible tutors will give you even more frequent feedback, sometimes at the end of the day.
